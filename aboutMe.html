                <h3>About me</h3>
                <p>
                    My name is Anita Owen. I am a web developer located in Queens, New York. I am currently training to be a Software Developer at Pursuit, an intensive 12-month software engineering fellowship with a 9% acceptance rate. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've always had an interest in computers growing up in the 90's. Computers back then would often have issues like frozen blue screens or corrupted files, etc. When these things would happen, I would research how to fix this problem and then try to fix it myself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am passionate about my family. When I'm not practicing code or studying, I spend most of my free time with them, making sure to keep a good work-life balance. </p>
                <p>
                    A cool fact about me is: I have been a jungle/drum&bass DJ for over 15 years.
