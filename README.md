### Project Stretch Goals

In the ongoing development of the Joke & Fact Explorer App, we're excited to share that we've successfully implemented several stretch goals to enhance the project's functionality and user experience:

1. **CSS Transitions for Enhanced Effects:**
   - Used CSS transitions to add dynamic and engaging effects to various elements on the page, providing a more interactive user interface.

2. **Modularization of CSS and JavaScript:**
   - Split the CSS and JavaScript code into multiple files, with each file dedicated to specific functionalities. This modular approach improves code organization, readability, and maintainability.

We believe that these enhancements contribute to making the Joke & Fact Explorer App a more comprehensive and enjoyable platform.

### Future Considerations
#### *Break Timer with Reminders*
We believe that a well-timed break can enhance productivity and well-being.
- A timer to help users schedule short breaks during work sessions.
- Adjustable intervals to suit individual preferences and work patterns.
- Automatic reminders to gently nudge users when their break time is up, encouraging a smooth transition back to work.

#### *Computer Trivia Section*
- Explore a new trivia section dedicated to computer-related questions.
- Engage with random computer trivia to test and expand your knowledge.
- Perfect for those moments when you want a quick mental challenge or a fun way to learn more about the tech world.


Stay tuned for updates as we work towards making the app not only entertaining but also a supportive companion in your workday!
